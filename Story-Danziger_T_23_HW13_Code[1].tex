\-\hspace{-1cm}3. The average electrostatic field in the earthâ€™s atmosphere in fair weather is approximately given:
\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = E_0 \left(Ae^{-\alpha z} + Be^{-\beta z}\right)\hat{z},
\end{equation}
   where A,B,$\alpha$,$\beta$ are positive constants and\textit{ z} is the height above the (locally flat) earth surface.
